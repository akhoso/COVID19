This notebook is inspired by a youtube video by jagesh naik in which he covers this notebook, check it out. The set of CSVs and datasets used are available on Kaggle.

The notebook continues on to fix the issue of plotly figures not showing up. it was due to some extension command needing to run, but that wouldnt execute unless NodeJS was present, which i installed, then the extension.

The figures finally worked after the above mentioned items were completed.
